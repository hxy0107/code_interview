Binary Tree Level Order Traversal Total Accepted: 59591 Total Submissions: 203755 My Submissions Question Solution
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
